Overview
--------

An ObjectiveMechanism is a `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>` that monitors the `OutputStates <OutputState>`
of one or more other ProcessingMechanisms specified in its `monitor <ObjectiveMechanism.monitor>` attribute,
and evaluates them using its `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`. The result of the evaluation is placed in the
ObjectiveMechanism's `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`.  ObjectiveMechanisms are typically used closely
with (and often created automatically by) `AdaptiveMechanisms <AdaptiveMechanism>`.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Creation:

Creating an ObjectiveMechanism
------------------------------

ObjectiveMechanisms are often created automatically when other PsyNeuLink components are created (in particular,
AdaptiveMechanisms such as `LearningMechanisms <LearningMechanism_Creation>` and
`ControlMechanisms <ControlMechanism_Creation>`.  An ObjectiveMechanism can also be created directly by calling its
constructor.  The two primary attributes used to define an ObjectiveMechanism are its `monitored_output_states
<ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_states>` and `input_states <ObjectiveMechanism.input_states>` attributes, specified
using the corresponding arguments of its construtor as described below.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States:

Monitored OutputStates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **monitored_output_states** argument of the constructor specifies the OutputStates it monitors.  The assignment of
the OutputStates to be monitored can also be passed from the **objective_mechanism** argument of the constructor for a
`ControlMechanism`, or the **monitor_for_control** argument of a `System` for which the ControlMechanism is a
`controller <System_Base.controller>`.  The **monitored_output_states** argument can be specified using a  list
containing any of the following:

COMMENT:
Note that some forms of specification may
depend on specifications made for the OutputState referenced, the Mechanism to which it belongs, and/or the Process
or System to which that Mechanism
belongs. These interactions (and the precedence afforded to each) are described below.
COMMENT

  * **OutputState** -- a reference to the `OutputState <OutputState>` of a Mechanism.  This creates a
    `MappingProjection` from it to the corresponding InputState in `input_states <ObjectiveMechanism.input_states>`.
  COMMENT:
      TBI
      Note that an outputState can be *excluded* from being monitored by assigning `None` as the value of its
      `monitoring_status` attribute.  This specification takes precedence over any others;  that is, it suppresses
      monitoring of that OutputState, irrespective of any other specifications that might otherwise apply to that
      OutputState, including those described below.
  ..
  TBI
  * **Mechanism** -- by default, the Mechanism's `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` is used.  However,
    if the Mechanism has any OutputStates specified in its `monitored_states` attribute, those are used (except for
    any that specify `None` as their `monitoring_status`). This specification takes precedence over any of the other
    types listed below:  if it is `None`, then none of that Mechanism's OutputStates are monitored; if it
    specifies OutputStates to be monitored, those are monitored even if they do not satisfy any of the conditions
    described in the specifications below.
  COMMENT
  ..
  * **Mechanism** -- the Mechanism's `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` is used.

  * **string** -- this can be used as a "placemarker", to specify that an `InputState` be created for an OutputState
    to be monitored that will be identified later.  The string is used as the name of the InputState when it is created.

  .. _ObjectiveMechanism_OutputState_Tuple:

  * **monitored_output_states tuple** -- this is a convenience notation that can be used to compactly specify a weight
    and exponent for an OutputState' (see `example <ObjectiveMechanism_OutputState_Tuple_Example>`). Each tuple must
    have the three following items in the order listed:

        * any of the specifications above -- if it is a string, the weight and exponent specified in the tuple
          (see below) will be assigned along with the string as the name of the "placemarker" InputState when it is
          created.
        |
        * a weight -- must be an integer or a float; multiplies the value of the OutputState before being combined with
          others by the ObjectiveMechanism's `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`.
        |
        * an exponent -- must be an integer or float; exponentiates the value of the OutputState before being combined
          with others by the ObjectiveMechanism's `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`.

    .. _ObjectiveMechanism_Weights_And_Exponents:

    .. note::
       The weight and exponent specifications in a tuple are used to specify the `weight <InputState.weight>` and
       `exponent <InputState.exponent>` of the corresponding InputState of the ObjectiveMechanism;  therefore,
       any values specified there take precedence over any other weight and/or exponent specifications of the
       InputStates for the ObjectiveMechanism.

  .. _ObjectiveMechanism_OutputState_Specification_Dictionary:

  * **monitored_output_states specification dictionary** -- this the most flexible form of specification, that can be
    used to specify one or more OutputStates of a Mechanism by their name

        * *MECHANISM*:`Mechanism <Mechanism>`
            this enty must be included in the dictionary;

        * *OUTPUT_STATES*:List[<str or any of the specifications above>, ...]
            here, a string can be used anywhere an OutputState would have been specified as the name
            of an OutputState belonging to the *MECHANISM* entry.

        If the dictionary includes only the *MECHANISM* entry, then (as with a standalone Mechanism specification),
        the Mechanism's `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` is used.  If a string is used for any items
        of the list in the *OUTPUT_STATES* entry, and it is not the name of the Mechanism in the *MECHANISM* entry,
        it will be treated as an "unbound" string specification.

If an OutputState to be monitored is specified at the time the ObjectiveMechanism is created, or the specification
can be resolved to an OutputState, a `MappingProjection` is automatically created from it to the corresponding
InputState of the ObjectiveMechanism using `AUTO_ASSIGN_MATRIX` as its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter.
If the OutputState can't be determined, no MappingProjection is assigned, and this must be done by some other means;
any values assigned to the ObjectiveMechanism's `monitored_output_states <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_states>`
attribute that are not associated with an OutputState at the time the ObjectiveMechanism is executed are ignored.


.. _ObjectiveMechanism_InputStates::

InputStates
~~~~~~~~~~~

When an ObjectiveMechanism is created, an InputState is created for each of the OutputStates specified in its
**monitored_output_states** argument, and a `MappingProjection` is assigned from each of those to the corresponding
InputState.  By default, the `value <InputState.value>` of each InputState uses the format of the `value
<OutputState.value>`  of its corresponding OutputState, and the MappingProjection between them uses an
`IDENTITY_MATRIX`.  However, the **input_states** argument can be used to specify the names of the InputStates
and/or customize their lengths (e.g., specify one that is different from the OutputState that projects to it).  Any of
the forms used for `specifying InputStates <InputState_Specification>` can be used in  the **input_states** argument,
including a list of strings (to be used as names for the InputStates), values (used to specify their length),
or `State Specification Dictionaries <State_Specification>`, with the following constraints:

  * the number of InputStates specified in the **input_states** argument must equal the number of OutputStates specified
    in the **monitored_output_states** argument (see the `examples
    <ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States_Examples>` below);
  ..
  * the `variable <InputState.variable>` of each must also be of the same type as the `value <OutputState.value>` of
    the corresponding OutputState, however their lengths can differ;  in that case, by default,
    a `FULL_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX` is used to create the MappingProjection between them (although this too can be
    customized using the *PROJECTION* entry of a `State specification dictionary <State_Specification>` for the
    InputState in the **input_states** argument;
  ..
  * a `weight and/or exponent <InputState_Weights_And_Exponents>` can be specified for each InputState (e.g., for use
    by the ObjectiveMechanism's `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`;  however, these are superseded by any weights
    and/or exponents specified in the **monitored_output_states** argument of the ObjectiveMechanism's constructor
    (see `ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States` and `note <ObjectiveMechanism_Weights_And_Exponents>` above).

COMMENT:
  * **string**, **value** or **dict** -- these can be used as placemarkers for a state to be monitored, that will be
    instantiated later (for example, for the TARGET input of a Composition).  If a string is specified, it is used as
    the default name of the corresponding InputState (specified in the `input_states <ObjectiveMechanism.input_states>`
    attribute of the ObjectiveMechanism). If a value is specified, it is used as the default value for the corresponding
    InputState.  If a dict is specified, it must have a single entry, the key of which is used as a string
    specification -- i.e., as the name of the InputState -- and the value as its value specification.
COMMENT

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Input:

Input
~~~~~

=An ObjectiveMechanism has one `InputState <InputState>` for each of the OutputStates specified in its
**monitored_output_states** argument (see `ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States`). Each InputState receives a
`MappingProjection` from the corresponding OutputState, the values of which are used by the ObjectiveMechanism's
`function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` to generate the value of its *OUTCOME* `OutputState
<ObjectiveMechanism_Output>`.  The InputStates are listed in the ObjectiveMechanism's `input_states
<ObjectiveMechanism.input_states>` attribute, and the OutputStates from which they receive projections are listed in
the same order its `monitored_output_states  <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_states>` attribute.  If any `weights
and/or exponents are specified <ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States>` for either the ObjectiveMechanism's
`monitored_output_states <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_states>` or its `input_states`, the former take
precedence over the latter.  These are assigned to the weights and/or exponents attributes of the ObjectiveMechanism's
`function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` if the function implements these attributes;  if so, the function applies the
weights and/or exponents specified to the corresponding InputState `value <InputState.value>`\\s before it combining
these to generate the ObjectiveMechanism's `output <ObjectiveMechanism_Output>`.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Function:

Function
~~~~~~~~

The ObjectiveMechanism's `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` uses the values of its InputStates to compute an
`objective (or "loss") function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function>`_, that is assigned as the value of its
*OUTCOME* `OutputState <ObjectiveMechanism_Output>`.  By default, it uses a `LinearCombination` function to sum the
values of the values of the OutputStates listed in `monitored_output_states`. However, this can be configured to
calculate differences, ratios, etc. (see `example <ObjectiveMechanism_Weights_and_Exponents_Example>` below).  It can
also be replaced with any `CombinationFunction`, or any python function that takes a nd array as its input (with a
number of items in axis 0 equal to the number of the ObjectiveMechanism's InputStates), and generates a 1d array as
its result. If it implements :keyword:`weight` and/or :keyword:`exponent` attributes, those are assigned from `weight
<InputState.weight>` and `exponent <InputState.exponent>` attributes of its `input_states
<ObjectiveMechanism.input_states>` (listed in its `monitored_output_states_weights_and_exponents
<ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_states_weights_and_exponents>` attribute);  otherwise, they are ignored.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Output:

Output
~~~~~~

The `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` of an Objective mechanism is a 1d array, named *OUTCOME*, that is the
result of its `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` (as described above).


.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

When an ObjectiveMechanism is executed, it updates its input_states with the values of the OutputStates listed in
its `monitored_output_states` attribute, and then uses its `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` to
evaluate these.  The result is assigned as to its `value <ObjectiveMechanism.value>` attribute as the value of its
`primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`.


.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Examples:

Examples
--------

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States_Examples:

*Specifying* **monitored_output_states**

The use of default_variable to override a specification in `monitored_output_states` can be useful in some situations.
For example, for `Reinforcement Learning <Reinforcement>`, an ObjectiveMechanism is used to monitor an action
selection Mechanism.  In the example below, the latter uses a `TransferMechanism` with the `SoftMax` function (and the
`PROB <Softmax.PROB>` as its output format) to select the action.  This generates a vector with a single non-zero
value, which designates the predicted reward for the selected action.  Because the output is a vector,
by default the InputState of the ObjectiveMechanism created to monitor it will also be a vector.  However, the
ObjectiveMechanism requires that this be a single value, that it can compare with the value of the reward Mechanism.
This can be dealt with by using `default_variable` in the constructor of the ObjectiveMechanism, to force
the InputState for the ObjectiveMechanism to have a single value, as in the example below::

    my_action_select_mech = TransferMechanism(default_variable = [0,0,0], function=SoftMax(output=PROB))

    my_reward_mech = TransferMechanism(default_variable = [0])

    my_objective_mech = ObjectiveMechanism(monitored_output_states = [my_action_select_mech, my_reward_mech])

Note that the OutputState for the ``my_action_selection`` and ``my_reward_mech`` are specified
in `monitored_output_states`.  If that were the only specification, the InputState created for ``my_action_select_mech``
would be a vector of length 3.  This is overridden by specifying `default_variable` as an array with two
single-value arrays (one corresponding to ``my_action_select_mech`` and the other to ``my_reward_mech``).  This forces
the InputState for ``my_action_select_mech`` to have only a single element which, in turn, will cause a
MappingProjection to be created from  ``my_action_select_mech`` to the ObjectiveMechanism's InputState using a
`FULL_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX` (the one used for `AUTO_ASSIGN_MATRIX` when the sender and receiver have values of
different lengths).  This produces the desired effect, since the action selected is the only non-zero value in the
output of ``my_action_select_mech``, and so the `FULL_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX` will combine it with zeros (the other values
in the vector), and so its value will be assigned as the value of the corresponding InputState in the
ObjectiveMechanism.  Another option would have been to customize the ObjectiveMechanism's
`function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` to convert the output of ``my_action_select_mech`` to a length 1 vector, though
this would have been more involved.  The next example describes a simple case of customizing the ObjectiveMechanism's
`function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`, however more sophisticated ones are possible, just as the one just suggested.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Weights_and_Exponents_Example:

*Customizing the ObjectiveMechanism's function*

The simplest way to customize the `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` of an ObjectiveMechanism is to
parametrize its default function (`LinearCombination`).  In the example below, the ObjectiveMechanism used in the
previous example is further customized to subtract the value of the action selected from the value of the reward::

    my_objective_mech = ObjectiveMechanism(default_variable = [[0],[0]],
                                           monitored_output_states = [my_action_select_mech, my_reward_mech],
                                           function=LinearCombination(weights=[[-1], [1]]))

This is done by specifying the `weights <LinearCombination.weights>` parameter of the `LinearCombination` function,
with two values [-1] and [1] corresponding to the two items in `monitored_output_states` (and `default_variable`).
This will multiply the value from ``my_action_select_mech`` by -1 before adding it to (and thus subtracting it from)
the value of ``my_reward_mech``.  Notice that the weight for ``my_reward_mech`` had to be specified, even though it
is using the default value (1);  whenever a weight and/or exponent parameter is specified, there must be an entry for
every item of the function's variable.  The `operation <LinearCombination.operation>` and `exponents
<LinearCombination.exponents>` parameters of `LinearCombination` can be used similarly, and together, to multiply and
divide quantities.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_OutputState_Tuple_Example:

As a conveninence notation, weights and exponents can be included with the specification of the OutputState itself, in
the **monitored_output_states** argument, by placing them in a tuple with the OutputState (see `monitored_output_states
tuple <ObjectiveMechanism_OutputState_Tuple>`).  The following example specifies the example same ObjectiveMechanism
as the previous example::

    my_objective_mech = ObjectiveMechanism(default_variable = [[0],[0]],
                                           monitored_output_states = [(my_action_select_mech, -1, 1), my_reward_mech])

This specifies that ``my_action_select_mech`` should be assigned a weight of -1 and an exponent of 1 when it is
submitted to the ObjectiveMechanism's `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`.  Notice that the exponent had to be
included, even though it is the default value;  when a tuple is used, the weight and exponent values must both be
specified.  Notice also that ``my_reward_mech`` does not use a tuple, so it will be assigned defaults for both the
weight and exponent parameters.


The following example uses a dictionary to specify the **monitored_output_states** argument, allowing several
OutputStates for the same Mechanism to be specified more easily, each by name rather than by full reference
(which is required if they are specified on their own or in a tuple::

    my_objective_mech = ObjectiveMechanism(monitored_output_states=[Reward,
                                                            {MECHANISM: Decision,
                                                             OUTPUT_STATES: [PROBABILITY_UPPER_THRESHOLD,
                                                                             (RESPONSE_TIME, 1, -1)]}])

Note that, as shown in this example, the tuple format can still be used for each individual OutputState in the list
assigned to the *OUTPUT_STATES* entry.

    input_states : ContentAddressableList[InputState]
        contains the InputStates of the ObjectiveMechanism, each of which receives a `MappingProjection` from the
        OutputStates specified in its `monitored_output_states <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_states>` attribute.

    function : CombinationFunction, ObjectiveFunction, function, or method
        the function used to compare evaluate the values monitored by the ObjectiveMechanism.  The function can be
        any PsyNeuLink `CombinationFunction` or a Python function that takes a 2d array with an arbitrary number of
        items or a number equal to the number of items in the ObjectiveMechanism's variable (and its number of
        input_states), and returns a 1d array.

    role : None, LEARNING or CONTROL
        specifies whether the ObjectiveMechanism is used for learning in a Process or System (in conjunction with a
        `LearningMechanism`), or for control in a System (in conjunction with a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`).

    value : 1d np.array
        the output of the evaluation carried out by the ObjectiveMechanism's `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`.

    output_state : OutputState
        contains the `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` of the ObjectiveMechanism; the default is
        its *OUTCOME* `OutputState <ObjectiveMechanism_Output>`, the value of which is equal to the
        `value <ObjectiveMechanism.value>` attribute of the ObjectiveMechanism.

    output_states : ContentAddressableList[OutputState]
        by default, contains only the *OUTCOME* (`primary <OutputState_Primary>`) OutputState of the ObjectiveMechanism.

    output_values : 2d np.array
        contains one item that is the value of the *OUTCOME* `OutputState <ObjectiveMechanism_Output>`.

    name : str : default ObjectiveMechanism-<index>
        the name of the Mechanism.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the Mechanism;
        if not is specified, a default is assigned by `MechanismRegistry`
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : Mechanism.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for Mechanism.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the Mechanism;
        if it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in ``__init__.py``
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
